<p>I worked for Liverpool City Council for 15 years as an integral part of their Digital Services team overseeing 5 design iterations of liverpool.gov.uk. In 2011 we performed a customer focused “Top Tasks” optimisation of the site which served as the template for a new generation of transactional council websites</p>
