    title: GOV.UK Alpha Discovery
    employer: cloudThing
    period: 2022
    content: This government department required a digital portal to manage complex licensing and permits from simple personal licences for individuals up to massively complex licences for multiple installations with national security implications. Stepping in last minute to cover for one of cloudThing's directors I produced the full Discovery piece (scheduled to run for 3 months) from scratch to get the project to GOV.UK alpha in 3 weeks, rescuing a key strategic partnership.
