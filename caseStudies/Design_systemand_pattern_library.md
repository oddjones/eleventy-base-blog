    title: Design system & pattern library
    employer: Blue Prism
    period: 2020
    content: In order to take Blue Prism's class leading enterprise  RPA software from the Windows desktop to the cloud we created the Hyperspace design system to facilitate Blue Prism's roadmap. A full featured design system and component / pattern library designed from scratch using Sketch and Figma, prototyped in Framer and built in React using the Storybook platform. It is packaged as a lerna monorepo. I was responsible for aspects of the whole system; from design, through documentation, code, testing, packaging, CI and deployment. V1 of Hyperspace was released in August 2020.
