    title: A pattern library for pattern libraries
    employer: cloudThing
    period: 2021
    content: cloudThing (now Kerv digital) wanted an accelerator to speed development of D365 back-ended portals built in React. Storybook was identified as the ideal delivery platform while it was acknowledged that the product might need to accept multiple react frameworks - teleportal was developed as a wrapper for any react framework (material-ui, gov-uk-react etc) closely coupled to a set of in-house APIs for connecting to Microsoft Dataverse. Teleportal is currently being used in development of AA accessible applications for UK government and 3rd sector organisations
