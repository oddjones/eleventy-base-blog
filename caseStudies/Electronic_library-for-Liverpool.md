    title: Electronic library for Liverpool
    employer: Liverpool City Council
    period: 2012
    content: ReadLiverpool is a full-featured electronic library for the citizens of Liverpool. I acted as Product Owner, Lead Designer and developed the site from photos to sketch, to mockup, to functional HTML/CSS/Javascript prototype. Working closely with library staff, the site was extensively usability tested across the full demographic range of Liverpool citizens so as to be as easy to use as possible.
