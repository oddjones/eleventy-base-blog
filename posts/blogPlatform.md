It'll probably end up on medium, with some posts perhaps useful for internal Kerv stuff and/or LinkedIn - but what I want is something really simple.

What does Adactio use for his blogging platform?

Jekyll - ruby based, hosted on github pages - simples

Here's the install instructions for Jekyll - try it out and see if it annoys you at all:

or just think a bit more about it firstðŸ˜‰ - Jekyll seems a bit old skool

Gatsby is the react way to do it - but it's a bit complex

it needs to :

- [ ] Use markdown docs
- [ ] Ideally just be a folder in whatever I'm using for my 2nd brain (Craft/Obsidian/Evernote WHY)
- [ ] Articles should have two simple states - DRAFT and PUBLISHED - that might be as simple as two folders or a flag set on the article (tag?)
- [ ] be portable
- [ ] It should be JAMStack - not Jekyll - because you're a javascript dev - not ruby
- [ ] Be free ;-)
- [ ] Publish to either netlify free tier? ($19/m) or github pages
- [ ] All the cool kids seem to be gravitating to 11ty - if it's good enough for Haydon Pickering and Andy Bell, then it's good enough for me.
