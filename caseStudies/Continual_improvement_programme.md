    title: Continual improvement programme
    employer: Liverpool City Council
    period: 2015
    content: Council websites typically get updated in huge “one-hit” projects every 5 years or so in-between which content & quality tends to deteriorate. I implemented a 2 year rolling improvement programme which ensured every section of Liverpool.gov.uk was revisited regularly, with content audits, user feedback and remote testing leading to in-programme mini-projects as well as generating larger projects for the development team. Integrated with the engagement strategy this also allowed us to start doing “digital transformation by the back door”
