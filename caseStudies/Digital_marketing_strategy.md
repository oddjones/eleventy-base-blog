    title: Digital marketing strategy for council fostering service
    employer: Liverpool City Council
    period: 2015
    content: I was engaged by Liverpool City Councilâ€™s fostering team to help resolve a crisis in local foster care provision due in large part to competition from more expensive Independent agencies targeting foster carers on social media and search. Working closely with the fostering team we convinced senior council leaders to fund a one-off proof of concept digital marketing push aligned with a relaunched and rebranded council fostering web offering.
